# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# cat1 = Cat.create!(age: 2, birth_date: "2013-01-31",
#                    color: "tortoise shell", name: "Gizmo", sex: "M")
# cat2 = Cat.create!(age: 1, birth_date: "2013-02-28",
#                    color: "black", name: "Breakfast", sex: "F")
